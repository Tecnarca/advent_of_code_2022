# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to the 2022 advent of Code coding challenge.
Or at least, the ones I get to solve in my free time during the holidays.

I use python for this challenge to test how much i've learnt over the past year and I'm trying to use the python standard and data science libraries as much as possible.
